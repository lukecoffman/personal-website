>[!def] Topological Space
>Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{T}\subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ be a collection of subsets of $X$ that obey the following:
>1. $\emptyset,X \in \mathcal{T}$
>2. If $\{O_i\}_{i\in I} \subset \mathcal{T}$ is an arbitrary collection of subsets then $\bigcup_{i\in I}O_i \in \mathcal{T}$
>3. If $\{O_i\}_{i=0}^\infty\subset \mathcal{T}$ is a countable collection of subsets then $\bigcap_{i=0}^{\infty}O_i\in \mathcal{T}$
>
>Then we say that $\mathcal{T}$ is a **topology** on $X$ and refer to the pair $(X,\mathcal{T})$ as a **topological space**.

> [!def] Subspace Topology
> Let $X$ be a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-topological-space\|topological space]] with topology $\mathcal{T}$. If $Y$ is a subset of $X$, the collection $\mathcal{T}_{Y}:\{Y\cap U:U\in \mathcal{T}\}$ is a topology on $Y$, called the **subspace topology**. With this topology, $Y$ is called a **subspace** of $X$, whose open subsets consists of all intersections of open sets of $X$ with $Y$.

>[!def] Continuous Function
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-topological-space\|topological spaces]]. A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is said to be **continuous** if for all $U\subset Y$ open $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.

> [!prop] Properties of Continuous Functions
> Let $X,Y$, and $Z$ be [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-topological-space\|topological spaces]].
> 1. (Constant function) If $f:X\to Y$ maps all of $X$ into the single point $y_{0}$ of $Y$, then $f$ is continuous.
> 2. (Inclusion) If $A$ is a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-subspace-topology\|subspace]] of $X$, the inclusion function $\iota:A\hookrightarrow X$ is continuous. 
> 3. (Composites) If $f:X\to Y, g:Y\to Z$ are [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous maps]], then $g\circ f:X\to Z$ is a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous map]].
> 4. (Restricting the domain) If $f:X\to Y$ is [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous]], and if $A$ is a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-subspace-topology\|subspace]] of $X$, then the restricted function $f\lvert_{A}:A\to Y$ is continuous.
> 5. (Restricting or expanding the range) Let $f:X\to Y$ be [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous]]. If $Z$ is a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-subspace-topology\|subspace]] of $Y$ containing $f(X)$, then $g:X\to Z$ is continuous. If $Z$ is a space having $Y$ as a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-subspace-topology\|subspace]], then the function $h:X\to Z$ obtained by expanding the range of $f$ is continuous.
> 6. (Local formulation of continuity) The map $f:X\to Y$ is continuous if $X$ can be written as the union of open sets $U_{\alpha}$ such that $f\lvert_{U_{\alpha}}$ is [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous]] for each $\alpha$.
>^prop-properties-of-continuous-functions

> [!exercise] Try and prove the above statements before checking the proof below.

> [!proof]-
> 1. Let $f:X\to Y$ be the function defined by $f(x)=y _0\in Y$ for all $x\in X$. Then for an [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-open-set\|open]] set $V\subset Y$, we have that $f^{-1}(V)$ is $X$ if $y_{0}\in V$ or $\emptyset$ if $y_{0}\not\in V$. In either case, the resulting set is open in $X$ implying that $f$ is [[Topology^continuous\|continuous]].
> 2. Let $A$ be a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-subspace-topology\|subspace]] of $X$. If $U$ is open in $X$, then $\iota^{-1}(U)=U\cap A$ which is open in $A$ by definition.
> 3. Let $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ be [[Topology^continuous\|continuous]] maps. Now for $U$ open in $Z$, we have that $g^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Y$. Since $g^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Y$, we have that $f^{-1}(g^{-1}(U))=(g\circ f)^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Therefore, $f\circ g$ is continuous.
> 4. Let $f:X\to Y$ be [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous]]. By the previous parts we have that $f\lvert_{A}:A\to Y$ is continuous as $f\lvert_{A}=f\circ \iota$ where $\iota:A\hookrightarrow X$ is the inclusion map.
> 5. Let $f:X\to Y$ be [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous]]. First, suppose that $Z$ is a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-subspace-topology\|subspace]] of $Y$ containing $f(X)$. Let $U\subset Z$ be open in $Z$, then $U=Z\cap\tilde{U}$ for $\tilde{U}$ open in $Y$. The preimage of $U$ is then $g^{-1}(U)=g^{-1}(Z\cap \tilde{U})=g^{-1}(Z)\cap g^{-1}(\tilde{U})=X\cap f^{-1}(\tilde{U})$ where $f^{-1}(\tilde{U})$ is open in $X$ by continuity of $f$. Therefore, $g:X\to Z$ is continuous. To show that $h:X\to Z$ is continuous observe that this is the composition of $f:X\to Y$ with the inclusion map $\iota:Y\to Z$.
> 6. Suppose that $X$ can be written as the union of open sets $U_{\alpha}$ such that $f\lvert_{U_{\alpha}}$ is [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous]] for each $\alpha$. Let $V$ be open in $Y$. Then we have that $f^{-1}(V)\cap U_{\alpha}=(f\lvert_{U_{\alpha}})^{-1}(V)$ by set theory. Since $f\lvert_{U_{\alpha}}$ is continuous this is open in $U_{\alpha}$ and further open in $X$ since $U_{\alpha}$ was assumed to be open. Therefore,
> $$
> f^{-1}(V)=\bigcup_{\alpha}(f^{-1}(V)\cap U_{\alpha})
> $$
> is the union of open sets implying that $f^{-1}(V)$ is open and that $f$ is continuous.
> 




>[!def] Homeomorphism
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-topological-space\|topological spaces]].  A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is said to be a **homeomorphism** if $f$ is a bijection and both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-continuous-function\|continuous]]. Symbolically, we write that $X\cong Y$ to say that $X$ is **homeomorphic** to $Y$ when such a function exists.
>^def-homeomorphism


>[!idea] Category theory view of continuous functions and homemorphisms
>Notice the similar behavior between the definitions and behaviors of the following

>[!idea]+ What is so "standard" about the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$?
>There are many topologies that can be placed on $\mathbb{R}$, however the standard topology is the *weakest* topology that can be given to $\mathbb{R}$ such that both $+$ and $\cdot$ are continuous operations. If you demand that the field operations are continuous then you obtain the standard topology. If you equip $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology it is clear that the field operations are continuous. 
>
>Now suppose $\mathbb{R}$ is equipped with the topology $\mathcal{T}$ and further that under this topology both $+$ and $\cdot$ are continuous. Then the map $T_x:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $T_x(y)=x+y$ is continuous. Additionally, observe that $T_{-x}\circ T_x=T_{x}\circ T_{-x}=\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}}$ so $T_x$ is a homeomorphism and $T_x^{-1}=T_{-x}$. Thus, for any open neighborhood $U$ of $0$ in this topology we have that $T_x(U)=\{x+u:u\in U\}$ is a neighborhood of $x$.


> [!def] Hausdorff Space
> Let $X$ be a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-topological-space\|topological space]]. $X$ is said to be **Hausdorff** if for every pair of distinct points $p,q\in X$, there exists disjoint open neighborhoods $U,V\subseteq X$ of $p$ and $q$ respectively.

> [!def] Second-countable
> If a [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-topological-space\|space]] $X$ has a countable [[Independent Learning/Math/Topology and Geometry/Topology#^def-basis\|basis]] for its topology, then $X$ is said to satisfy the **second countability axiom**, or to be **second-countable**.
