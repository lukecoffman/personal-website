# Overview
> [!question] What is Boolean functional analysis?
> Boolean functional analysis is truly about how we can use [[Independent Learning/Math/Analysis/Harmonic Analysis\|Harmonic Analysis]] on discrete systems to say interesting things about their properties. At face value, the subject of interest are functions $f:\{0,1\}^{n}\to\{0,1\}$, however, through the techniques of [[Independent Learning/Math/Analysis/Harmonic Analysis\|Harmonic Analysis]] we can extend this to a more general discussion about potentially complex valued functions on discrete groups.

# Section 1

> [!def] Boolean function
> A **Boolean function** is a function $f:\{0,1\}^{n}\to \{0,1\}$ that takes as input $n$-length bit strings and outputs a single bit. Throughout this document we may call functions $f:\{-1,1\}^{n}\to \{-1,1\}$ a Boolean function (as we will for most cases) or identify $\{0,1\}^{n}$ with $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$. All of these are equivalent representations though some may be more useful than others given the circumstances.

We refer to the domain $\{-1,1\}^{n}$ as the **Boolean Cube**.
